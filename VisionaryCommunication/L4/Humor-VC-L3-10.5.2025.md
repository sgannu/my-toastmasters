# SeeSaw - Communicating with Left-Brain and Right-Brain Thinkers 

## Introduction: 

- The terms "left-brained" and "right-brained" are based on the theory of lateralization, which suggests that different cognitive functions are handled by different sides of the brain. 
- While modern neuroscience shows that both sides of the brain work together and the distinction is oversimplified, these terms provide a useful framework for understanding different communication and thinking styles. 
- Communicating effectively with individuals who favor one style over the other requires tailoring your message to their preferences. 

## The Left-Brain Communicator 

#### Key traits: 
**Logical, analytical, and detail-oriented.** 

#### Communication preferences: 

	- Facts and figures: They appreciate data, evidence, and statistics to support an argument. 
	- Structure and order: Information should be presented in a logical, step-by-step format, such as with bullet points or outlines. 
	- Clarity and brevity: They value concise, clear communication and can lose patience with rambling explanations. 
	- Focus on results: They are often results-oriented and respond well to discussions about measurable goals and outcomes. 

## The Right-Brain Communicator 

#### Key traits: 
**Creative, intuitive, and focused on the big picture.** 

#### Communication preferences: 

	- Stories and emotion: They are more receptive to emotional appeals, storytelling, and vivid imagery. 
	- The big picture: They prefer a broad vision or overarching goal rather than getting bogged down in details. 
	- Creativity and flexibility: They thrive in open-ended discussions and less structured environments that encourage brainstorming. 
	- Metaphors and analogies: These can be powerful tools to help them connect with an idea. 

 ## An Examples: 
 
 #### The Home Renovation
 
 - A couple is trying to decide on new wallpaper for the living room. 

**Left-Brain Partner**

"According to my calculations, based on the room's square footage and the paper's specs, we will need 6.5 rolls. Rounding up to 7 rolls, the total cost, including tax and adhesive, will be $234.62. The pattern repetition is 18 inches, so we will have 12 inches of waste per strip." 

**Right-Brain Partner**

"This one makes me feel so good! It’s like a peaceful spring day, with little bluebirds flying on the wall. It’s a bit over budget, but just imagine how happy we'll be when we're sitting here, surrounded by these little birds, sipping our tea." 

## Crafting Messages: A Framework 

#### When starting a conversation: 

	- For the Left-Brain: Start with the main point. "The project budget is over by 10%." 
	- For the Right-Brain: Start with the context. "I was just thinking about the big picture for our project, and I have some thoughts on our resources." 

#### When explaining a new idea: 

	- For the Left-Brain: Use a clear, step-by-step process. "First, we will establish a baseline. Second, we will track metrics. Third, we will analyze the results." 
	- For the Right-Brain: Paint a picture of the outcome. "Imagine a world where our customers are so delighted they become our biggest advocates. This is how we get there." 

#### When discussing a problem: 

	- For the Left-Brain: Focus on the facts. "The data shows a 20% drop in Q3 sales, directly correlating with the new market entry." 
	- For the Right-Brain: Focus on the emotion and impact. "The team is feeling a bit demoralized because our work isn't having the impact we'd hoped. I want to find a way to re-energize us." 

## Conclusion:

- Increase understanding and minimize misunderstandings. 
- Strengthen relationships by showing you value how others think. 
- Improve collaboration and achieve better outcomes. 

Ultimately, the goal is not to label people, but to adapt your communication to help everyone feel heard and understood.
